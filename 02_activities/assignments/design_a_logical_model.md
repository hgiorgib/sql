# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
ANS:

*Type 1: Overide changes*
- customer_id (PK) + (FK): in customer table
- address
- city
- province
- postal code
- country

*Type 2: Retain changes*
- address_id (PK)
- customer _id (FK)
- address
- city
- province
- postal code
- country
- valid_date
- expire_date


## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. 

ANS:

Differences:
*Complexity: 
- AW schema is a more complex system that composed by 6 sub-schemas for the processes of Sales, Purchasing, Person, production, HR, and DBO. It contains 70 tables in total.
- My schema is a simple design for a physical bookstore composed by 6 tables to store info related to employees, customer, sales, books, orders and dates.

 *Scope:
- AW schema joints the interaction of 6 functional work groups or department that operate a big bookstore with the following scopes: i) international transactions, ii) online and in-store sales, iii) HR management, iv) whole and retail sales, v) offer promotions, and vi) book production.
- My schema was design for a physical retail bookstore that keeps the data of its orders, sales, customers and books.

Would you change anything in yours?

If I had to broaden the scope on my bookstore, I would consider to add some of the tables of the AW schema to offer services such as online sales and international transactions.
