**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my experience working with SQL queries and data management, I’ve always focused on things like efficiency, accuracy, and making sure everything runs smoothly. However, I’ve recently started to reflect on how data practices intersect with ethics and equity, and it’s clear that the way we handle data can have far-reaching effects. While writing queries or managing datasets seems purely technical, those actions feed into larger systems that can shape people’s lives in significant ways.

The article about Pakistan’s digital family database really made me think about how centralized data collection can raise concerns about privacy and fairness. It’s a good reminder that just because a system is designed to be efficient doesn’t mean it’s neutral—it could unintentionally reinforce biases or limit people’s autonomy. With this in mind, I’d adjust my approach by paying more attention to the ethical impact of the data I work with. Instead of just focusing on whether the data is clean and usable, I’d start asking questions about how it’s collected, who benefits from it, and whether it could harm vulnerable groups.

Ultimately, integrating ethics and equity into my data work would mean taking a more holistic view of the impact of my decisions. It’s not just about building efficient queries or accurate reports—it’s also about thinking critically about how the data affects real people and making sure my work supports more fair and inclusive outcomes.
